_Note: We previously had different Gnosis Safe mobile apps available. We made the decision to deprecate them and focus on the Gnosis Safe Multisig entirely. _[_Learn more about the differences_](https://help.gnosis-safe.io/en/articles/4100541-gnosis-safe-multisig-vs-legacy-safe-mobile-app)_ or _[_how to re-download the old mobile app_](https://help.gnosis-safe.io/en/articles/4290400-how-to-re-download-the-legacy-gnosis-safe-mobile-app)_ if you previously had it installed._
