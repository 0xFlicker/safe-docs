# Relay Kit

The [Relay Kit](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-core-sdk/tree/main/packages/relay-kit) allows users to pay transaction fees (gas fees) using the native blockchain token or ERC-20 tokens. This allows you to pay gas fees using any ERC-20 token in your Safe, even if you don't have ETH.

## Quickstart

In this quickstart guide, you will send some tokens to another address using the Relay Kit to pay for the gas fees. For full effect, you can try this with an externally-owned account that has no tokens. See the full code example [here](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-docs/blob/main/examples/relay-kit/index.ts).
