# Auth Kit

The [Auth Kit](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-core-sdk/tree/main/packages/auth-kit) creates an Ethereum address and authenticates a blockchain account using an email address, social media account, or traditional crypto wallets like Metamask. You can obtain the ethereum address and the associated safe addresses as an output for the sign in process.

The guides linked in this section demonstrate how to use the Auth Kit and integrate it into your project by using one of our provided packs:
