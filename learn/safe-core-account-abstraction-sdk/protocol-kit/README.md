# Protocol Kit

The Protocol Kit uses the [safe-core-sdk](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-core-sdk/tree/main/packages/safe-core-sdk) to allow users to create and configure[ Safe contracts](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-contracts) and execute single and multi send transactions.

## Getting Started

This is a short tutorial on creating a Safe using the core-sdk. For a more detailed guide, including how to integrate with safe-core-service and web3js, see [Integrating the Safe Core SDK](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-core-sdk/blob/main/guides/integrating-the-safe-core-sdk.md).
