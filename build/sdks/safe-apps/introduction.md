# What are Safe Apps?

With over $1B worth of digital assets held in Gnosis Multisigs alone, itâ€™s essential for the dapp ecosystem to access the untapped market of multi-signature wallets. Safe Apps introduce a completely new way for developers to build their dapps right into a Multisig interface. Turn your Dapp into an HTML iframe component that can be accessed through the Safe Multisig. We are providing extensive developer tooling to make it easy to develop, test and integrate Safe Apps into the Safe Multisig. This includes a unique design system, reusable components and a Safe App SDK that facilitates the Safe App &lt;&gt; Safe Multisig communication.

Please refer to this [EthCC3 talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GirpNHZPJM&t=168s) to learn more about Safe Apps.

There are already Safe Apps available for a number of popular protocols such as [Aave](https://aave.com/), [Synthetix](https://synthetix.io/), [1inch](https://1inch.exchange/) or [Balancer](https://balancer.finance/). These have been build by 3rd party developers or the projects themselves.

If you are missing a Safe App, get in touch with the respective project or get building with the Safe Apps SDK below. There is even a grants program available:

#### Safe Apps Grants

We have an ongoing program to finance the development of Safe Apps through grants with up to $3000. These grants are meant as an incentive for the community to extend the functionality of the Safe Multisig and enable small projects or independent developers to build their first Safe App.

Find more information about our grants program [here](https://github.com/gnosis/GECO/blob/master/Safe%20Apps%20Grants/Safe%20Apps%20Grants.md).
