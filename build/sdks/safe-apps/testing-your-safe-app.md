# Testing your Safe App

While developing your Safe App you can directly use [our production interface](https://gnosis-safe.io/app) for testing it. Some testnets like Rinkeby are also available there.

Once your app is live, even if you are running it locally, you can import it to the Safe application as a custom app. To do so, you should select the "Apps" tab:

Use the `Add custom app` button and add your app using a link:

We also made a very simple interface for testing Safe Apps that can be used on any network: [https://dev.gnosis-safe.io/](https://dev.gnosis-safe.io)
